The goal of making the cipher files is to help me get familiar with languages that I haven't spent much time with. 
It was a concept that I saw in college, making the same project but using different languages to see how they differ.
I chose a cipher due to my cybersecurity specialization and a need to experiement with the concepts that I learned. 
I figured that if I can make this into an extension or an app that people can use for fun and experiment with ciphers.
