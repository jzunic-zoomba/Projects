# **Disclosure**

Please note that the majority of the projects that are in this folder is meant to be automated. While making these I was using a yml file and GitHub actions.
With a couple adjustments it should work with Windows Task Scheduler or Azure Automation. 
I tried my best to make it so you didn't need any paid tools to get these projects to work.
