Despite this being designed for three people on HaloPSA, it is possible to adapt this to other websites. 
Just note that for any of this to work you need to have access to the website API (either the key or client credentials) and a scheduler.
I chose GitHub actions because of the built in secrets feature which allows a more secure way of storing information.

Like I said earlier this can be adapted for other websites and is not limited to three people, that is just what I did.
