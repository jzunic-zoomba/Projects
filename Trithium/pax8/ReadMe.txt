While initially deisgned to be a standalone file, this can easily be added to an onboarding script 
to help add licenses to the users. 
It is designed to access the licences the user can purchase and send a reciept. 
It connects to your account and does the work through API to get the job done.
It is possible to modify the code to instead of looking at the list to just search for one though,
but the point of it generating all the available licenses is in case of a name change.
